# Rust State Machine

Project developing a simple state machine using rust, based on the course ‘Rust State Machine: Basic Concepts for Blockchain Development’ from Dotcodeschool [Rust State Machine: Basic Concepts for Blockchain Development](https://dotcodeschool.com/courses/in-browser-rust-state-machine).


## Some tools

1. Formatter
```
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
touch rustfmt.toml
cargo +nightly fmt
```

Run the last command (for formatting the code) every time you write more code.
